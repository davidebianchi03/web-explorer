# Web-Explorer Code of Conduct

## Overview

Welcome to the Web-Explorer open-source community! We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of background or experience. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for everyone involved in our project, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all contributors to:

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Be collaborative and supportive.
- Refrain from any form of discrimination, harassment, or offensive behavior.
- Exercise empathy and understanding towards differing opinions and experiences.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully and learn from it.
- Focus on what is best for the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or intimidation in any form.
- Offensive comments related to personal characteristics.
- Sustained disruption of discussions or events.
- Any form of unwelcome attention or unwanted contact.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to address any reported or observed behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting [contact person or email]. All reports will be kept confidential, and anonymous reporting is also available.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, both online and offline, where community members are present. This includes our GitHub repository, mailing lists, chat rooms, and any events or meetings.
