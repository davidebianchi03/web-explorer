### **What is Web Explorer?**
<hr>
Web Explorer is a web file explorer that:

- Allows you to access to **files that are on your computer** with a web interface
- Allows you to access to **files that are on a NAS** without using directly Samba (web explorer connects to the nas with the samba protocol and shows you the files in a website)
